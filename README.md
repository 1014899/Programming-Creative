# Aim: 

The goal of this project is for students to create a creative response to Microcontroller  Systems. This response could be a project that shows off what you can do; a tutorial on a method, practice, concept, sensor, component, library,  etc. 

# Unit Goals:
Demonstrate an understanding of microcontrollers and interfacing electronic hardware as it relates to a Microcontroller system 
Explore and examine the computer programming to effectively control Microcontroller systems
Demonstrate an understanding of the Programming Design Cycle as it relates to Microcontroller Systems

- Write how you change from python to arduino
- Conditions , Iterations, Functions, Objects
- Write about for loops for buzzer

## Minor Project
For my creative response, Zainab, Oanh and I decided to collaborate on a minor project. We created three different components - I created a piezo buzzer changing the frequency and placing it onto one breadboard and one arduino. Oanh created the LED part by using a 3mm LED light, a breadboard and an arduino, whilst Zainab created the servo motor using a servo motor, breadboard and an arduino.
