# Aim: 
The goal of this project is for students to create a creative response to Microcontroller  Systems. This response could be a project that shows off what you can do; a tutorial on a method, practice, concept, sensor, component, library,  etc. 

# Unit Goals:
Demonstrate an understanding of microcontrollers and interfacing electronic hardware as it relates to a Microcontroller system 
Explore and examine the computer programming to effectively control Microcontroller systems
Demonstrate an understanding of the Programming Design Cycle as it relates to Microcontroller Systems

# Minor Project
For my creative response, Zainab, Oanh and I decided to collaborate on a minor project. We created three different components - piezo buzzer, servo motor and LED light and combined them all together to get something that resembles a prison which would help us in our LegoCity project in the future. 

I was tasked to create the piezo buzzer which would become the alarm sound in the prison. I used a tutorial online and had changed the code slightly to make the object function as I wanted it to. I also changed the frequency of the buzzer and how fast the buzzer would play to what I thought would be in a prison (loud and annoying), this sound was mostly based on movies and games. The piezo buzzer component was created with a resistor, piezo buzzer, a breadboard, an arduino and wires. At first, the buzzer wasn’t working as the tutorial explained and this was because the buzzer’s arms (the things at the bottom of the buzzer) weren’t long enough. Due to this minor inconvenience, I changed the buzzer to a different spot but using a resistor to touch the positive line on the breadboard.

Zainab was tasked to create the servo motor which could become the mechanic that would open and close the doors. She used a tutorial online and had slightly changed the code by changing the angle of the motor and changing how regular the servo would turn on. The servo motor component was created with a servo motor, breadboard, an arduino and wires. The servo motor was the easiest to create as the tutorial was self explanatory and we had no inconveniences. Oanh was tasked to create the LED section of our “prison”. At first, we decided to use an RGB LED as it had more colour variety, but we changed on the 3mm red LED as we wanted the light to be bright and one colour. She used the “Blink” example code we had previously used and changed the code slightly to create a “circling” pattern to mimic a prison. The LED component was created with a 3mm red LED, a breadboard, an arduino and wires.

 By combining these, we have our final product. During our project, we had three designs. The first design was by simply combining them and trying to match the servo motor, LED and buzzer to be in sync. The second design was the same as the previous but an addition of a button so we could change if the project was turned on or off. In the last and final design, we removed the button and used the milliseconds() function to turn off all machines simultaneously. (As shown in our flowchart).

- Write how you change from python to arduino
- Conditions , Iterations, Functions, Objects
- Write about for loops for buzzer
